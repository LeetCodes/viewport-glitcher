# page-glitch

Chrome extension which takes a screenshot of current viewport, glitches it, and opens the result in a new tab. 

## Status

Currently using [Glitchy3bitdither](https://github.com/JKirchartz/Glitchy3bitdither) which unfortunately doesn't look great. 

TODO: Use [glitch-canvas](https://github.com/snorpey/glitch-canvas) instead.
